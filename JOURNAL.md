# Day 1 - June 13th(PT1)

I decided on a 60% layout, as I wanted this to travel w/ me. I used the default 60% from keyboardlayout <br>

I also made the schematic for this<br>

I wanted this keyboard to have two encoders; one for volume dialing and one for general page navigation, so I put them both there<br>
I did use a diode matrix, with through-hole diodes as I wanted to hand-solder this.<BR>
Still not sure on which switches to use, but i'm certain I want something creamy/thocky. Would love to use milky whites or oil kings
**Total Time spent: 4hr**

# Day 2 - June 13th(PT2)

Today, I also routed the PCB for this -<br>

Again, I wanted to keep it small as this is a travel keyboard so the dimensions are 292x124mm<br>
**Time Spent: 6hr**

# Day 3 - June 14th
